# AB-Test-Results--Analyze-Website-Landing-Page

In this project, I conduct an A/B test on a new landing page versus an old page run by an e-commerce website to understand whether I should recommend that the company implement the new page on their website. I work to understand the results of an A/B test and confirm the accuracy of the results by also running a regression to see if the results align.  

My goal was to analyze the data using A/B testing and logistic regression to determine if the new landing page results in a higher conversion rate than the old webpage.

Ultimately, the results are inconclusive and the new landing page does not result in a higher conversion rate than the existing page so it is not recommended that the company implement the new page.
