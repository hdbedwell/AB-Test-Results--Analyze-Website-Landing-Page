# AB-Test-Results--Analyze-Website-Landing-Page

In this project, I work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to ultimately recommend whether the company should implement a new webpage on their website. 

My goal was to analyze the data using A/B testing and logistic regression to determine if the new webpage results in a higher conversion rate than the old or current webpage.
